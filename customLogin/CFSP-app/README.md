# CoinFlipStockPredictor: The Backend and Frontend

Each folder here will have a markdown file explainin what
the fuck is going on.

## Todos ✔️
This is the todo list for both frontend/backend

 - [✔️ ] **FIND SOME WAY TO PASS DATA FROM FRONT TO BACKEND**
 - [✔️ ] Make a user model for logging in backend (A.K.A Schemas)
 - [✔️ ] Fetch data from the forms in login page
    - [✔️ ] If user enters stupid shit or is not even in the databases, then throw some errors here and there.
    - [✔️ ] If user IS in the database, redirect the user to the home page with their user profile.
 - [✔️ ] Make sign in page for new users

## Notes
All of this may need to be implemented on the main branch.
